A {brand-name} powered Chrome extension that scans web sites as you visit them. 
See recent scan history, scan now or use the portal for deeper analysis. 

The tool is open source so you can modify as you wish.

#### How does it work?

Once installed, the plugin is notified by the browser of page requests and then sends them to Secplugs for analysis.
If you 'pin' the extension you can see an icon that indicates status and when click shows a pop menu. 
The menu provides functions like 'Scan Now' and 'View Scan History'.

#### How do I get started?

Download and install web secure directly from the [Google Chrome Store Listing](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/secplugs-web-secure/pdhkebbpndcoebankoedojjiepmgomgc), post installation, surf the web as you normally would.
Use the secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective analysis.

To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering with {brand-name}, sign in with your username and [create an API key](docs?doc=docs/HowTo/CreateKey) 
You can then use the {brand-name} portal to view activity, run reports and do deeper retrospective threat analysis.

Note : Google Chrome extensions are published in the Chrome Web Store, where you can download and add them directly to your browser. 
Any extensions you add will be saved in the right-hand corner of Chrome, allowing you easy access to their settings.
