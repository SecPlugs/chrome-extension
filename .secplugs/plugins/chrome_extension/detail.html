<h5>What is the <b>Chrome Extension</b> Plugin?</h5>
<p>
The Chrome Extension works from within the Chrome browser to scan web sites as you visit them. 
</p>

<h5>How does it work?</h5>
<p>
Once installed, the plugin is notified by the browser of page requests and then sends them to Secplugs for analysis.
You should be able to see the sec plugs icon turning green for all the clean hits and a red floater for all the malicious URLs and you can perform automated and manual on-demand URL scans. The plugin icon also shows you how many URLs you have scanned across all sites. To configure the extension to use the vendor of your choice, you need to register in secplugs.com

<h5>How do I get started?</h5>
<p>
Download and install web secure from chrome store, post installation, surf the web as you normally would.
Use the secplugs console to view activity, run reports and do deeper retro spective analysis.
</p>
<p>
To use additional features and the privacy of your own account, after registering in Secplugs.com, login with your username and create an API key to use with the scripts.
